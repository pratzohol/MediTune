# MediTune

Implementation of fine-tuning methods on medical dataset 

## 1. Resources

- GPU : Nvidia RTX 2070 (8GB)
- CPU: Intel i9-10885H (16 GB RAM)

## 2. Fine-tuning Methods

1. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)
2. PEFT (LoRA and QLoRA)

## 3. Objective

- Chose MCQ dataset for simplicity in evaluation metric (accuracy in this case)
- The objective was modeled as an instruction-tuning objective. 
- It could be modeled as a classification task also.
